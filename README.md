# MARP - Dijkstra Algorithm

This was the final assignment of the subject "Métodos Algorítmicos en Resolución de Problemas 1" which I took during the third year studying at UCM.

The proyect consisted of an implementation of the Dijskstra algorithm and the creation of the data structures needed to represent a graph. The objective was to correctly implement the algorithm and the data structures, and checking that indeed the time complexity of the algorithm is O((a+n)lg(n)) where a represents the number of edges of the graph, and n represents the number of nodes of the graph.

The result of the project and implementation details can be found in the file "Práctica MARP.pdf"
